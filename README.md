P.H.A.R.M.A.C.E.U.T.I.C.A.L. is a python program created to be a pharmacy software. At its core, the program features basic functions of pharmacy operations, allowing the user to work with medications, patients, and documents to virtually simulate a pharmacy experience. Further patches to the program will focus on implementation of additional features that are strongly correlated with pharmaceuticals, security measures, as well as data retention to improve the simulation experience.
